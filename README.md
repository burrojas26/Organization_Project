Project to aid in organization of the seven hills robotics team

Program will interact with hardware to recognize parts using a neural network to recognize general parts and weight measurement to further classify exact parts.
Once the part is recognized the program will activate leds corresponding to where the part is stored.

Additional features to be implemented later:
- A database that stores extra info about parts
- a search bar and interface to lookup info about a part/where it is stored
